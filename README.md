Java-based File Packer-Unpacker app for secure packing and unpacking of multiple file types. – Implemented user authentication with 3-attempt validation, Caps Lock detection, and password length verification. – Designed packing and unpacking logic with metadata, encryption, checksum logging, and magic number verification to ensure data integrity
File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption

Technology: Java Programming

Project Overview

This project is a Java-based file utility tool that provides functionality for packing multiple files into a single archive and unpacking them back with all metadata preserved.

To enhance security, the packed file is encrypted, and only authorized users can decrypt & extract the data.

The project also features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.
